# Low-Level Programming Repository

Welcome to the **Low-Level Programming** repository! This project is dedicated to learning and mastering C programming as part of the **ALX Software Engineering** curriculum. 

## About This Repository

This repository contains various C programming exercises and projects that focus on low-level programming concepts. These exercises are part of the ALX SE program, which aims to build a solid foundation in software engineering through practical, hands-on learning.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to specific modules or topics within the ALX SE program. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you can find:

- **0x00-hello_world**: Introduction to C programming, including setup, first programs, and basic syntax.
- **0x01-variables_if_else_while**: Working with variables, conditional statements (`if`, `else`), and loops (`while`).

### Getting Started

To get started with the exercises in this repository:

1.  **Clone the repository**:

    -   Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

        bash

        Copy code

        `git clone https://github.com/KGhartey17/alx-low_level_programming.git`

2.  **Navigate to a directory**:

    -   Change to the directory that contains the module you want to work on. For example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `cd alx-low_level_programming/0x01-variables_if_else_while`

    -   This command takes you to the folder for the "Variables, if, else, while" module.
3.  **Compile the C programs**:

    -   Use `gcc` to compile the C programs with the recommended flags. For example:

        bash

        Copy code

        `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 filename.c -o output`

    -   Replace `filename.c` with the name of your C source file, and `output` with the desired name for your executable.
4.  **Run the compiled program**:

    -   Execute the compiled program using:

        bash

        Copy code

        `./output`

    -   Replace `output` with the name of your executable file.
