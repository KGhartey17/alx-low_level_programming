### 2. Collaboration is multiplication

*File: 2-mul.c*

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

### 3. The numbers speak for themselves

*File: 3-print_numbers.c*

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

### 4. I believe in numbers and signs

*File: 4-print_most_numbers.c*

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line, but do not print 2 and 4.

### 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language

*File: 5-more_numbers.c*

Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

### 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

*File: 6-print_line.c*

Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

### 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

*File: 7-print_diagonal.c*
