# Debugging Project

## Tasks

### 0. Multiple mains

**File**: `0-main.c`, `main.h`

- Create a file named `0-main.c` to test the function `positive_or_negative()` for the case of `0`. Only `0-main.c` and `main.h` are required.

### 1. Like, comment, subscribe

**File**: `1-main.c`

- Comment out the part of the provided code that causes an infinite loop. The output should show that the infinite loop is avoided.

### 2. 0 > 972?

**File**: `2-largest_number.c`, `main.h`

- Fix the `largest_number` function to correctly print the largest of three numbers in all cases.

### 3. Leap year

**File**: `3-print_remaining_days.c`, `main.h`

- Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so it works correctly for all dates and leap years. This function should convert a date to the day of the year and determine how many days are left in the year, considering leap years.
